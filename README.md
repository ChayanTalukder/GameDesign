# Game Design - TripleX

The name Triple X comes from the fact that the entire game is based around three unknown numbers. The main
idea here is that a player is given a set of statements and is needed to find a valid three number
combination.

For this personal projectPure C++ was used to write the entire program in order to understand
the use of C++ in designing basic game architectures. The game Triple X starts easy, and as we
keep playing the game it becomes much harder as it ramps up difficulty.
